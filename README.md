This is a little experiment with the Google Drive API

For now, it only allows downloading a .odt given its Google Docs ID (this
is the long part in the URL).

The worst part of the experience was that I had to go to

	https://code.google.com/apis/console/

click on Services, and activate the Drive API manually.
